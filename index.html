                <h3>Flight Controller for Boeing 737-800</h3>
                <p>This project involved designing a controller and simulating a Boeing 737-800 aircraft using Simulink and FlightGear. The goal of this controller was to keep the airplane at a constant pitch angle. To develop the controller, I started by using principles of 3D dynamics to generate a state-space model for the aircraft. Next, using that state-space model, I used Simulink to generate a closed-loop block diagram with a PID controller to adjust the altitude in real time. The PID controller was tuned using Simulink's PID Tuner application. To verify the control system, a step input was fed into the closed loop and simulated with FlightGear.</p>

                <p>Using the FreeFlyer software, I calculated and programmed a simulation to simulate the Hohmann transfer from Earth to Mars. The FreeFlyer software is a program designed for simulating the orbit of spacecrafts, with the programing language utilized being similar to Java. The process of modeling starts with calculating the Hohmann velocity, which is done using the axes of the orbits and gravitational parameter of the sun. Next, the phase angle is computed. With both of these and some additional setup in the FreeFlyer software, we can simulate our spacecraft's orbital transfer.</p>

Using OpenRocket, I designed a simple rocket, ensuring stability by selecting parts to make the center of gravity and center of pressure are towards the bottom of the rocket. Next, using ANSYS/OpenFOAM, I have set up a fluid dynamics simulation to attempt to calculate drag generated in my rocket design. </p>

                <p>Using MATLAB and Simulink, I developed, tested, and simulated optimal control algorithms for a bipedal robot. The two control algorithms that I chose to implement were Model Predictive Control (MPC) and the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) algorithm. With the Simscape Multibody MaTLAB add-on, I was able to develop graphs to display the results of each algorithm. From my results, the LQR algorithm provided better gait but worse path following, whereas the MPC algorithm stayed on its path better but had an awkward gait. </p>

                <p>This project applied reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to develop a control policy for a quadcopter. The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) algorithm was used for the control of the quadcopter, and this control algorithm is tuned by modifying its Q and R matrices. The goal of this project is to find Q and R matrices that  minimize mean position and velocity error for the quadcopter. While the RL model was programmed in Python, the simulation, control, and testing of the quadcopter is done in MATLAB.</p>

In order to implement this, I chose to utilize Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). The dataset used in the initial training had 877 images with annotations with images of four classes: speed limit signs, traffic lights, stop signs, and crosswalks. The first training of the developed algorithm achieved an accuracy of around 87%. At the moment, I am building on this project with the goals of improving accuracy, broadening the dataset to include more classes, and integrating OpenCV for real-time detection. ROS2 Humble is used to integrate all of the programs. </p>

                <h3>BadgerFly</h3>
                <p>Halfway through my third year, I became affiliated with BadgerFly, a new organization on campus, as its vice president. I would become president in the second half of my senior year. BadgerFly is UW-Madison's first club focused on drone and VTOL flying and engineering. As president, I handled much of the team's administrative tasks and oversaw our overall project. Our goal was to design a VTOL aircraft for participation in the Vertical Flight Society's Design-Fly-Build competition. Our VTOL build is a tiltrotor VTOL, with two tilting motors at the edge of our fixed wings and a single propeller at the back for stability. While I generally worked on all aspects of engineering, my main focus was with software and controls, with much of my time spent researching autonomous VTOL flight and control systems to keep our aircraft stable. </p>

                <p>From the start of my second year, I became involved with UW's AIAA organization. This organization's competition team was centered around a small-scale high powered model rocket for participation in Spaceport America Rocketry Competition. Being one of the few ECE majors on the team, I was one of the leaders of the avionics subteam. In this subteam, we handled all of the electronic components in the rocket for tasks such as sensor measurement, propulsion, and recovery/landing. A fair amount of circuit building and design was done in order to ensure system correctness and component redundancy. </p>

                <h3>Badger Solar Racing</h3>
                <p>For a large duration of my third and fourth years of undergraduate, I was a member of the Firmware team of Badger Solar Racing (formerly BadgerLoop). Our role in this subteam was to work on the control system of the car. This mainly involved creating a state machine to represent the car's different states (park, idle, etc) and utilzing digital signals in order to know when to change states. In addition to this, we worked on a PID controller to allow for PID control of our car. I utilized MATLAB in order to tune the PID controller.</p>

                <h3>Aerial Robotics Competition Teaml</h3>
                <p>Upon starting my graduate program at KSU, I decided to join ARCT. Our club's goal is to develop a lightweight autonomous aircraft for the SAE Aero Design challenge. I am a part of the GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control) subteam, in which I primarily focus on our aircraft's communication and GPS systems. Our communication system relies on the use of two 900Mhz telemetry modules to strike a good balance of strength and range in our connection. For the GPS system, we are attempting to integrate multiple techniques in order to improve our accuracy as much as possible, with the main optimization being the usage of real-time kinematics (RTK). In addition to RTK, we also are attempting to implement post-processing kinematics (PPK) and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in conjunction with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in order to perform sensor fusion. </p>
